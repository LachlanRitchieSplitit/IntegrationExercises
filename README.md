Hey team-

With our goals being sent in, I’d like to share one of mine with you (I’ll share them all of course, but let’s focus on one for now). It has to do with up-leveling and standardizing the skillset across our team.

When I interviewed for this position, Tuba and Ran asked me to complete an exercise which I’ve come to absolutely love. It has to do with actually doing the thing we ask our customers to do, and living through the experience ourselves: Implement our SDKs and APIs.

Over the first quarter of 2022, I’d like to see how we each do this. So, I’ll be setting out some simple tasks to help get started. The first is this: create a public GitHub repo and share with Tuba and myself.

You may already have this. If so, cool! Done! If not, go create one. It’s very easy, and will be the foundation for the rest of the tasks. We’ll go slow and steady, and by the end of this half, we’ll each (myself included) have a shared example of the Splitit API and a working end-to-end flow.

This first task is super easy, so let’s target completion by 18th February. Feel free to customize a hello world entry, or whatever, but the task is as easy as creating and sharing the repo.

I am here if you have any questions. Feel free to reach out to myself, or anyone. Part of the exercise is getting answers by asking questions. I look forward to seeing how you show your skills!

Let’s go!

Ron
